# Next.js PDF Downloader

This project is a simple Next.js application that generates a PDF file with multiple pages containing images and text. It leverages the power of [@react-pdf/renderer](https://react-pdf.org/) for PDF generation along with [Tailwind CSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pdf-tailwind/) for styling.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kahnu044/nexts-pdf-downloader.git
```
## Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server. You can access the app at http://localhost:3000.

## How it Works
The app provides a user interface with a "Download PDF" button. When clicked, it generates a PDF file with multiple pages, each containing an image and some sample text.

## Tailwind CSS
This project also utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. You can find the Tailwind CSS classes used in the index.js file.

## Acknowledgements
